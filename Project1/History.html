                        colonial roots than any other borough in NYC! In <i>Staten Island</i> there are plenty of places in which you can visit and experience what 
                        it was trully like living in colonial times!

        <p>One such place you can visit is <i><b>Historic Richmond Town</b></i>(pictured right). It is a whole town full of preserved buildings
        from way back when. Pay it a visit and have a unforgetable experience.</p><br>
        <p>A fun fact about Staten Island is that it played a big role in the battle of rhode island in the revolutionary war.
            Over <i>30,000</i> brave troops were stationed in the island and had a advantagious position because of this.
