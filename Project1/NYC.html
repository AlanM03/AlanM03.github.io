        <p><i>NYC</i> is a place of rich culture and wide acceptance of all ways of life. The best way to describe such a place would be the "<i><b>melting pot</b></i>" of the world as no matter where you may be from originally 
        there is a 101% chance a community with your values and culture will bring you in.</p><br>
        <p>Another thing to mention about <i>NYC</i> is that it has arguably some of the best food! You can quite literally order and eat anything you want! If it comes to mind its just a click or walk away!
        we pride ourselves as a city for our varying cultures dwelling in the city and that culture also happens to include every food imaginable!</p><br><hr>
